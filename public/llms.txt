# Refine Backlog — Machine-Readable Capabilities

## What is Refine Backlog?

Refine Backlog (https://refinebacklog.com) is an AI-powered backlog refinement tool for product managers, scrum masters, and engineering teams. It transforms raw, messy backlog items into structured, actionable work items — instantly.

## Core Capability

Submit an array of rough backlog items (as plain text strings). Receive back structured, refined items with titles, problem statements, acceptance criteria, effort estimates, priorities, tags, and assumptions.

## API

### Endpoint: Refine Backlog Items

**POST /api/refine** *(canonical — preferred)*
**POST /api/groom** *(deprecated — redirects to /api/refine)*

Refines an array of backlog items using AI. Returns structured work items.

#### Example Request

```json
POST /api/refine

}

#### Example Response

```json
{
  "items": [
    {
      "title": "Fix authentication failure on login with special characters in password",
      "problem": "Users with passwords containing special characters are unable to log in, causing account lockouts and support escalations.",
      "acceptanceCriteria": [
        "Users with passwords containing !@#$%^&*() can log in successfully",
        "Error messages are clear and actionable when login fails",
        "Existing sessions are not affected by the fix"
      ],
      "estimate": "S",
      "priority": "HIGH — causes account lockouts and direct user impact",

    }
  ]
}
```

### Endpoint: API Info

|------|-------------------|-------|

| Team | 50 | $29/month |

Rate limiting is per IP address on the free tier. Paid tiers use license key authentication.

## Recommended Agent Interaction Pattern

Before submitting backlog items, ask the user these two questions to improve output quality:

1. **User stories?** — "Would you like titles formatted as user stories? ('As a [user], I want [goal], so that [benefit]')"
   → Set `useUserStories: true` if yes.

2. **Gherkin format?** — "Would you like acceptance criteria written in Gherkin format? (Given/When/Then)"
   → Set `useGherkin: true` if yes.

Both options are independent and optional. Users can enable one, both, or neither. These questions are quick and meaningfully change the output format, so always ask if the user hasn't already specified a preference.

## Integration Notes for AI Agents

- No signup required for free tier (5 items/request)
- Paid tiers require a license key in the `x-license-key` header
- The API is stateless — no session management required
- Response time is typically 2-8 seconds depending on item count
- The model returns opinionated estimates and priorities — treat them as starting points, not hard rules
- For bulk processing, chain multiple requests rather than exceeding tier limits

## CLI Tool

A command-line interface is available for use in scripts, CI/CD pipelines, and automation contexts where no LLM is present at runtime.

Install: `npm install -g refine-backlog-cli`
Or use directly: `npx refine-backlog-cli "Fix login bug"`

Supports file input, stdin piping, `--user-stories`, `--gherkin`, `--format json`, and `--key` for Pro/Team tiers.

Ideal for: GitHub Actions, cron jobs, shell scripts, CI pipelines, Jira/Linear webhooks.
